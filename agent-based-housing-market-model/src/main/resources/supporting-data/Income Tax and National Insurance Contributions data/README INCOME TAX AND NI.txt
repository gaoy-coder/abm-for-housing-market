Note that the income bands for income tax are after personal allowance, i.e., they do not include the general personal allowance. On the contrary, the income bands for national insurance contributions do already include the initial untaxed allowance. The different standard used for both files is due to the fact that income tax personal allowance needs to be computed during the simulation, as it depends on gross annual income, while the untaxed allowance for national insurance contributions is fixed and can thus be safely included within the bands.
